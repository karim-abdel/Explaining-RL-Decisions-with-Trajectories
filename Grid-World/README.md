This folder is regarding experiments of 'Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories': A Reproducibility Study. 


The files are concerning the following parts of our study:

1. `table1_and_DTDAclaim` contains results reproducing table 1 of our paper. We also brefly mention how to obtain visually the DTDA claim.
2. `clustering_and_humanstudy_expts` is taking care of claim Clustering High-Level Behaviours. It also contains additional experiments regarding DBSCAN clustering and its comparison with XMeans. Additionally it also contains plots regarding the conducted Human Study.
3. `different_encoder_hyperparams_expts` is made of additional experiments to be further investigated on both chaning the encoding trajectory technique as well as tweaking some hyperparameters hoping to obtain better results.
