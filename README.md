# Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories: A Reproducibility Study

This repository contains the codebase for our reproducibility study on "Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories." Our work is conducted in the context of the Fairness, Accountability, Confidentiality, and Transparency in AI course offered by the University of Amsterdam.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts, each contained in its own directory with dedicated `requirements.txt` files and `README` for setup instructions:

- **Grid-World Experiments:** Located in the `Grid-World` folder, this part includes all necessary code to replicate the gridworld experiments described in the original study.
- **Seaquest and Half Cheetah Experiments:** The `Seaquest_HalfCheetah` folder contains code for replicating experiments on the Seaquest and Half Cheetah environments.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the `README.md` file within each directory for detailed instructions on setting up and running the experiments.
